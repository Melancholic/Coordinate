== About
<b>Coordinate</b> - a non-profit, and free product, with a number of registered trade marks and free libraries.

<b>Coordinate</b> will allow you to monitor the location of your vehicle, view tracks, and detailed statistics. I tried to make service, as comfortable as possible for the end user, while not forgetting about the safety of the system as a whole.

The project is developing, and your opinions and suggestions are important to me. You can send them to me via any appropriate form on the site of the project  or by e-mail.

Thank you for your attention!
